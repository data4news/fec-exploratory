The campaign finance data is available in bulk at https://www.fec.gov/data/browse-data/?tab=bulk-data

I have used [this open source code](https://github.com/ethan-homan/fec-gov-postgres) to pump the data from 2008-2022 into a postgres database. 

`database.ipynb` contains some python code that will allow you to access that postgres database via SQL queries for the purposes of exploratory data visualization.
